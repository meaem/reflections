$ When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

* Using remote repositories is essential for working collaboratively with other 
  team members.

* They facilitates collaboration between members.
* Also working on open source systems mostly benefits from these repos.

*******************************************************************************    

$ Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

* First I might have current work on some files that i don't want them to be swiped out when 
  automatic pull is done.

* Second 'pull' can pull any branch from the remote repo. But which of them I want to pull?
  I don't want any new branch to be automatically pulled into my machine unless i really want that

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

*	branches: 
		- Are series of subsequent commits which are based on each other. They
			are needed in situations like adding new feature without affecting 
			the current running version of the software. Or even when testing 
			some alternative solution without touching the current RUNNING one.
			
		- One repository might have more than one branch. 
		- the default branch name is "master"
		- Branches could be merged into each other. This might lead to a 
			conflict when both branches have specific changes in the same 
			part of a file
			
		- To see all branched type "git branch"
		- To create a new branch type " git branch branchName" 
		- To checkout a branch type " git checkout branchName"
		- To delete branch type " git branch -d branchName"
		- To create and checkout new branch type "git checkout -b newBranchName"
		- To merge a branch (branchName) into another (master) first you have to 
		    checkout the master "git checkout master" then merge
		  "git merge branchName"
		  
*	clones
		- Are copies of repositories either from a remote source or local source.
		- cloning could be done over the repository with all its branches.
		- to clone a repository from GitHub type "git clone REPO_URL"
		- cloning retrieve all commit history of all branches
		
*	forks
		- Are GitHub alternative for cloning into GitHub itself.
		- This means that a fork is a typical version of the source repository
			but on GitHub.
		- When you fork a repository, its will be added to your repositories by default.
		- Then you can clone it on your local machine and update it locally.
		- When you push your updates, they are pushed into you forked repository not 
			the original one.
		- Then you can make a "pull request" to the repository owner to check 
		  your updates and either accept them or not.
